# Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples
No. | LIST | TUPLE
---|---|---
1 | List are mutable. | Tuples are immutable.
2 | The implication of iterations is Time-consuming. |The implication of iterations is comparatively Faster.
3 | The list is better for performing operations, such as insertion and deletion. | Tuple data type is appropriate for accessing the elements.
4 | Lists consume more memory. | Tuple consumes less memory as compared to the list.
5 | Lists have several built-in methods. | Tuple does not have many built-in methods.
6 | The unexpected changes and errors are more likely to occur. | In tuple, it is hard to take place.
